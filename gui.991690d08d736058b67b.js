I\'m sorry you have just run into an exception.\nIf your debugger ends up here, know that some reaction (like the render() of an observer component, autorun or reaction)\nthrew an exception and that mobx caught it, to avoid that it brings the rest of your application down.\nThe original cause of the exception (the code that caused this reaction to run (again)), is still in the stack.\n\nHowever, more interesting is the actual stack trace of the error itself.\nHopefully the error is an instanceof Error, because in that case you can inspect the original stack of the error from where it was thrown.\nSee `error.stack` property, or press the very subtle "(...)" link you see near the console.error message that probably brought you here.\nThat stack is more interesting than the stack of this console.error itself.\n\nIf the exception you see is an exception you created yourself, make sure to use `throw new Error("Oops")` instead of `throw "Oops"`,\nbecause the javascript environment will only preserve the original stack trace in the first form.\n\nYou can also make sure the debugger pauses the next time this very same exception is thrown by enabling "Pause on caught exception".\n(Note that it might pause on many other, unrelated exception as well).\n\nIf that all doesn\'t help you out, feel free to open an issue https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/issues!\n',m038:"Missing items in this list?\n    1. Check whether all used values are properly marked as observable (use isObservable to verify)\n    2. Make sure you didn't dereference values too early. MobX observes props, not primitives.

The heap is a cone 19.5\ninches in diameter and 6 inches\nhigh.  With these values, the volume\nof the bushel is 684.5 pi in^3 and\nthe heap occupies 190.125 pi in^3.\nTherefore, the heaped bushel is\n874.625|684.5 bushels.

Wire Gauge\n\nThis area is a nightmare with huge charts of wire gauge diameters\nthat usually have no clear origin. There are at least 5 competing wire gauge\nsystems to add to the confusion. The use of wire gauge is related to the\nmanufacturing method: a metal rod is heated and drawn through a hole. The\nsize change can\'t be too big. To get smaller wires, the process is repeated\nwith a series of smaller holes. Generally larger gauges mean smaller wires.\nThe gauges often have values such as "00" and "000" which are larger sizes\nthan simply "0" gauge. In the tables that appear below, these gauges must be\nspecified as negative numbers (e.g. "00" is -1, "000" is -2, etc).\nAlternatively, you can use the following units:',"51.1. American Wire Gauge (AWG) or Brown & Sharpe Gauge appears to be the most\nimportant gauge. ASTM B-258 specifies that this gauge is based on geometric\ninterpolation between gauge 0000, which is 0.46 inches exactly, and gauge 36\nwhich is 0.005 inches exactly. Therefore, the diameter in inches of a wire\nis given by the formula 1|200 92^((36-g)/39). Note that 92^(1/39) is close\nto 2^(1/6), so diameter is approximately halved for every 6 gauges.

A change to the metric system\nstarted in 1921 but there was a lot of resistance. The Measurement Law of\nOctober 1999 prohibits sales in anything but SI units. However, the old\nunits still live on in construction and as the basis for paper sizes of books\nand tools used for handicrafts.\n\nNote that units below use the Hepburn romanization system. Some other\nsystems would render "mou", "jou", and "chou" as "mo", "jo" and "cho".\n\n\nhttp://hiramatu-hifuka.com/onyak/onyindx.html','63.6. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_units_of_measurement\nsays: "Volume measure in Taiwan is largely metric".'],comment:""}},{line:"australiasquare = (10 ft)^2",info:{headings:["64.
